**Toggle Scrollbars** allows you to see the scrollbar at all times. This is useful because the scrollbar also contains source control change markers. With scrollbars always visible you can more easily locate changes across the entire length of your document.

## Usage

To configure this preference, open **Extensions â†’ Extension Library...** then select Toggle Scrollbars' **Settings** tab. You can then tick **Always Show Scrollbars** checkbox.

> Important: you will need to restart Nova to see the changes.
